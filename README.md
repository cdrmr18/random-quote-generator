# random-quote-generator

project 1

<!-- Program uses a random generator function to create random quote objects using the length value of the array that is passed as an argument. The function returns an object using the random number as the index selector.

The selected quote object is then passed into html context with dot notation to retrieve applicable properties.

Two if statements are in place to check existence of a citation, year, or tag. If exist, then a span element with element will be added to quoteDisplay.

Final result is a web display of random quotes being inserted into the page when refreshed or button is clicked.
